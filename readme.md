# MDL Liteclient

This repository contains a liteclient for MDL written in Go. At the moment it is only used to compile
an [Android Archive](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library.html)
and a JS library with [gopherjs](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs).

MDL Liteclient supports go1.10+.

## Compiling Android aar and jar

For the compilation process to Android Archive, we use [Go Mobile](https://github.com/golang/mobile).

```bash
$ gomobile bind -target=android github.com/MDLlife/mdl-lite/mobile
```

## Compile javascript library

For the compilation process to javascript library, we use [gopherjs](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs).

To compile the library use `make build-js` or `make build-js-min` (if you want the final file to be minified).
After compiling, the main.js and main.js.map files will be created/updated in the root of the repository.

## Development

The javascript library is created starting from [gopher/main.go](gopher/main.go). The Android library is
created starting from [mobile/api.go](mobile/api.go).

### Updating the MDL code

To mantain compatibility, avoid errors and facilitate the update process, the
[MDL](https://github.com/MDLlife/MDL) code is added as vendored dependency through `dep`. However,
if the MDL code is updated using dep, `make build-js` and `make build-js-min` will stop working,
because MDL uses dependencies that are not compatible with gopherjs. To solve this problem, it is
necessary to execute `make fix-skycoin-dependency` after updating the dependencies with dep.

### Formatting

All `.go` source files should be formatted `goimports`.  You can do this with:

```sh
make format
```

### Code Linting

Install prerequisites:

```sh
make install-linters
```

Run linters:

```sh
make lint
